Programs for the [RCA 1802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COSMAC_ELF).

I bought and built a [computer](http://www.retrotechnology.com/memship/memship.html) powered by an RCA 1802. When it was introduced in 1976, it cost a very affordable $100. The kit I purchased came with a whopping 32k of RAM.

Since it has a DMA controller, you can directly input binary code, and run it. Fun stuff!
